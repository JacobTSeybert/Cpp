# comments refelect a lot of the logic to be used for this program but a few key details.

##
1. Some lines a commented out, these lines of code do work
  1a. These lines allow for the clicker to be at random time intervals instead of always at a specifed amount of time
  1b. Erros with this was randNum woul go up by time would stay within seconds of itself, therefore was not random enough.
2. Sleep(#####) the number embedded is set for a click every three (3) minutes at time of writing this.
  2a. This amount of time can be changed, it is set in a time of 60000, or one (1) minute. 
3. Program is setup to be a double click, you cans et this however you like, I found double clicks more practical. 
4. Some "Errors" I've run into, is program will not wait for the intial menu choice of 'X' sometimes it does. Worth looking into if you like/prefer perfection.
